# projects

This repo contains snippets of code I have written in the last six months.

## checkio

This folder contains selected solutions to given problems from http://checkio.org. Each script begins with a docstring
briefly explaining the task being solved as well as a link to the checkio task page.

## coursera

This folder contains some code I wrote while participating in Rice University's
[computer science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/fundamentalscomputing2?utm_medium=listingPage) courses on
Coursera.

Each script is a game that can be played by following the commented link at the top of each script, and then clicking
the play button in the top left. Note that I did not build the GUI for fifteen_puzzle or tictactoe_minimax.

## math

This folder contains some tidbits of code I came up with while carrying out mathematical research.
